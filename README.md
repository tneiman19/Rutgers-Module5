# Rutgers-Module5 (Work Day Scheduler)

# Task 
Provided with starter code, we were tasked with writing a daily planner.

This project should have the following features

- When we click a save button, the text in that text area saves in local storage.
- When the page loads, the text saved in local storage is placed in the correct text area.
- The current date is displayed at the top of the page using Moment JS.
- Using moment JS, we apply the class Past, Present, or Future is applied to each container.  These classes will give a visual if that hour has passed or not. 

## Additionally

Host this on GitHub Pages and include a screenshot in this README file as well.
